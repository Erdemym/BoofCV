Trackers
- SURF
- Detect region/normalized cross correlation

- See KLT list

- Weighted corner detection
 * compute corner description using weights, such as Guassian distribution
   Should provide more invariance for rotation

- Add whole image detection capability to SSD detectors
 * Hunt through code where it expands the avoid border
 * Main reason for adding image borders is to avoid this headache.

- Do all non-max feature suppression process borders?

- How to handle interest point and corner detector?
