Trackers
- Detect region/normalized cross correlation

- Faster association
  - FLANN?

- See KLT list

- Non-Maximum Suppression for edges
 * Add a crude version 4 which just checks to see if gradient is > or < 0 to pick direction of line

- Canny Edge Detector
 * Uses generalized algorithm for non-max.  Use a specialized one for speed that traces
   the edge intensity and direction

- Weighted corner detection
 * compute corner description using weights, such as Guassian distribution
   Should provide more invariance for rotation

- Add whole image detection capability to SSD detectors
 * Hunt through code where it expands the avoid border
 * Main reason for adding image borders is to avoid this headache.

- Ignore Borders
  * WrapperKitRosCornerIntensity: add ignore border parameter for when the derivative has an ignore border?
  * WrapperLaplacianBlobIntensity: same
