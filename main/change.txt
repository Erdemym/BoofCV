Version : Alpha 0.3

- Camera Calibration
  * Planar grid (Zhang 98)
  * Camera calibration matrix from homographies
  * Linear radial distortion
  * Decomposition of homography for calibration
  * Nonlinear optimization of all parameters
- Calibration Grid Detection
  * Detects corners up to "pixel accuracy", in reality its probably worse than that
  * Sub-pixel accuracy code exists but needs more work
- Added min and max values to ImageTestingOps.addGaussian()
- Tweaked factories related to wavelet denoising so that they take in
  an image type.
- Removed cyclical dependency between modules by creating a visualize modules
- Added to BinaryImageOps
  * label to clusters
  * clusters to binary
- Renamed ImageBase to ImageSingleBand
- Created a new ImageBase
- Flushed out MultSpectral image type more and extended ImageBase
  * Created functions to convert to and from BufferedImage
- Changed behavior of several functions in GeneralizedImageOps to include
  MultiSpectral images
  * refactor createImage -> createSingleBand 
- Updated ant scripts
  * Common template is now used for the different modules
  * Fixed unit test and make it work across the whole project
- Added crop to ImageDistort
  * If cropping is used the only part of the destimation image is processed
- Created calibration package to hold calibration related code
- Moved jars not part of the primary build into boofcv/lib/testing
- Started converting runtime benchmark code over to Caliper
  * http://code.google.com/p/caliper/

---------------------------------------------
Date    : 2011/12/01 
Version : Alpha 0.2

- Added integer polynomial interpolation
  * Cleaned up polynomial interpolation code
- Fixed bug in PixelMath.bound() dealing with unsigned images
- Converting to a BufferedImage now marks it as modified
- Added min and max pixel values to ImageTypeInfo
- Added ComplexMath
- Added PolynomialSolver
- Added process(image) to PointSequentialTracker and renamed it to ImagePointTracker
- Added the following 3D vision code:
  * Linear 8-point essential/fundamental matrix
  * Linear 7-point essential/fundamental matrix
  * Linear 4-point homography
  * Extract camera motion from essential
  * Extract camera and plane normal from homography
  * Triangulate: Linear pixel depth
  * Projective N Point (PNP): Linear N >= 6
- Added non-linear optimizer based upon Levenberg-Marquardt
- Added pixel region based descriptors
  * Raw pixel values
  * Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC)
- Added pixel region based trackers
- Added Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) feature association score for several different descriptor types.
