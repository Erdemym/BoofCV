- EPnP
  * Case 4
  * Planar data
  * Nonlinear optimization

- Bundle Adjustment
  * Unweighted
  * Weighted

- PnP Stability Evaluator
  * General Case
  * Planar Data
  * Variables
    - Number of observations
    - Noise magnitude
    - Distance of points

- Triangulation Stability
  * Vary acute angle

- Long Term
 * Sparse Bundle Adjustment
 * P3P algorithm
 * 5-pt Fundamental
 * Switch homography from DenseMatrix64F to Homography2D_F64?
  - Need to add functions to geometry math or create a new class
  - Also add a generic Matrix3x3_F64 to georegression

- Move Trackers to Features?
- Remove distinction between 2D and 3D algorithms?
- Reconsider how DLT is handled
 * Have normalization be handled outside of the estimator algorithms
 * Change documentation to make this fact extremely clear
