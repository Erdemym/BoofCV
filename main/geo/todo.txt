    - Number of observations
    - Noise magnitude
    - Distance of points

- Triangulation Stability
  * Vary acute angle

- Long Term

- Move Trackers to Features?
- Remove distinction between 2D and 3D algorithms?
- Reconsider how DLT is handled
 * Have normalization be handled outside of the estimator algorithms
 * Change documentation to make this fact extremely clear
