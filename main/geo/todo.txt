- Compare EPnP directly to author's c code

- Bundle Adjustment
  * Unweighted
  * Weighted


- Triangulation Stability
  * Vary acute angle

- Long Term
 * Sparse Bundle Adjustment
 * P3P algorithm
 * 5-pt Fundamental
 * SVD/Linear PnP  See Long Quan paper
 * Switch homography from DenseMatrix64F to Homography2D_F64?
  - Need to add functions to geometry math or create a new class
  - Also add a generic Matrix3x3_F64 to georegression

- Move Trackers to Features?
- Reconsider how DLT is handled
 * Have normalization be handled outside of the estimator algorithms
 * Change documentation to make this fact extremely clear
