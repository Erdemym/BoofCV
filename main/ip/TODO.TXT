- Rename all low level implementation classes to have Impl* in their name

- Features
 * Abstract out KLT feature descriptions

- Wavelet
 * Generate coefficients for arbitrary daub and coiflet wavelets
 * Add Symmlet wavelet
 * Support for Image64F
 * Unrolled inner image
 * After adding new wavelets update denoising code

- Derivative
 * Overflow in integer derivatives.
   - Provide support for ImageSInt32?
   - Do a better job bormalizing?
   - See ShowImageDerivative
 * Check comments for Sobel and Prewitt.  Can you really compute it from those kernels?
 * Include the image border for the Laplacian

- Denoise
 * After an integer wavelet has been added that is energy conserving:
   - Create performance test and visualization apps
 * Use high order wavelets when available
 * In particle image there seem to be out of bound pixel value issues

- Thresholding
 * Adaptively select global threshold
 * Local Threshold

- Corners
 * See corner section
 * See in code comment on speeding up fast-non-max

- Lines
 * Improve grid based detector
 * Improve sub image foot? Remove duplicates and such.

- Convolve
 * Add support for convolutions using kernels width:
   - Even length (offset + length)
   - Different width/height
 * Make sure convolve kernel flips the directions of one of the kernels
 * Wait are all the convolution algorithms convolve in the WRONG direction?!?!?
   - Most kernels are symmetric so this would not appear to be an issue in general
 * Add a new implementation for horizontal and vertical which are "in-place"
   Uses an array one row/column long in which the image is locally copied.
 * Sparse Kernel Convolve for when there is a lot of zeros in the kernel
   - Unroll
   - Compare speed to hand derived kernels in gradient

- Kernels
 * Should Gaussian kernels be provided with only the exp() part?
   - For numerical stability.  These are not app
 * Support kernels with an even size
 * Support different width and height

- Improve Sort Median Filter
 * Use bubble sort to avoid resorting each time

- Interpolate
 * Remove unsafe in pixel.
   * That operation would only be used in specialized cases, which likely could have further optimizations.
   * Pro of keeping it is that it could make this easier to program in the long run
 * Bicubic seems to have overflow issues
 * Move 1D interpolation into libpja?
 * Add more types to polynomial, improve tests, and refine

- Have a morphological filter section?
 * Add gray scale morphological operators
 * Handle image edges for binary and gray scale
   - Create a wrapper around image for naive implementation.
     + zeros or ones when outside of image for dilation and erosion
