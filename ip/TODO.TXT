- Name Ideas
 * Able Vision

- Rename all low level implementation classes to have Impl* in their name

- Wavelet
 * Generate coefficients for arbitrary daub and coiflet wavelets
 * Support for Image64F
 * Unrolled inner image
 * GUI Panel to display wavelets
   * change the level being viewed
   * display detail on a log scale

- Median Filter
 * Image Edges, handle them

- Derivative
 * Gaussian derivative kernel 1D
 * Improve performance of derivative edge calculation

- Edges
 * Whole image:
    - Intensity and orientation
 * Wavelet based detector
 * Connected Segments
    - Canny?

- Denoise
 * Weiner
 * TAWS denoiser
 * SureShrink

- Thresholding
 * Global Threshold
 * Adaptively select global threshold
 * Local Threshold

- Corners
 * See corner section
 * See in code comment on speeding up fast-non-max
 
- Convolve
 * Add a new implementation for horizontal and vertical which are "in-place"
   Uses an array one row/column long in which the image is locally copied.
 * Sparse Kernel Convolve for when there is a lot of zeros in the kernel
   - Unroll
   - Compare speed to hand derived kernels in gradient

- Improve Sort Median Filter
*   Use bubble sort to avoid resorting each time

- InterpolateRectangle
 * Have output be an image

- Convolve Sparse
 * Optimize a bit more by only running the re-normalize code on the outer most regions.
 * Delete if nothing is using it

- Have a morphological filter section?
 * Add gray scale morphological operators
 * Handle image edges for binary and gray scale
   - Create a wrapper around image for naive implementation.
     + zeros or ones when outside of image for dilation and erosion
