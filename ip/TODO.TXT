- Name Ideas
 * Able Vision

- Rename all low level implementation classes to have Impl* in their name

- Wavelet
 * Generate coefficients for arbitrary daub and coiflet wavelets
 * Add Symmlet wavelet
 * Support for Image64F
 * Unrolled inner image
 * GUI Panel to display wavelets
   * change the level being viewed
   * display detail on a log scale
 * After adding new wavelets update denoising code

- Derivative
 * Gaussian derivative kernel 1D
 * Improve performance of derivative edge calculation
 * Include the image border for the Laplacian

- Edges
 * Whole image:
    - Intensity and orientation
 * Wavelet based detector
 * Connected Segments
    - Canny?

- Denoise
 * After an integer wavelet has been added that is energy conserving:
   - Create performance test and visualization apps
 * Use high order wavelets when available
 * In particle image there seem to be out of bound pixel value issues

- Thresholding
 * Adaptively select global threshold
 * Local Threshold

- Corners
 * See corner section
 * See in code comment on speeding up fast-non-max
 
- Convolve
 * Add support for convolutions using kernels width:
   - Even length (offset + length)
   - Different width/height
 * Add a new implementation for horizontal and vertical which are "in-place"
   Uses an array one row/column long in which the image is locally copied.
 * Sparse Kernel Convolve for when there is a lot of zeros in the kernel
   - Unroll
   - Compare speed to hand derived kernels in gradient

- Improve Sort Median Filter
*   Use bubble sort to avoid resorting each time

- Interpolate
 * Remove unsafe in pixel.
   * That operation would only be used in specialized cases, which likely could have further optimizations.
   * Pro of keeping it is that it could make this easier to program in the long run

- Have a morphological filter section?
 * Add gray scale morphological operators
 * Handle image edges for binary and gray scale
   - Create a wrapper around image for naive implementation.
     + zeros or ones when outside of image for dilation and erosion
