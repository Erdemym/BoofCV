Description of what type of code goes into each GECV package:

- alg:
             Where algorithms go.  Algorithms should be written for ease of implementation and speed.  They should only
             use data structures which make sense from the algorithms perspective alone.  No generalization.
- interface
             Interfaces which generalize families of algorithms go here.  This is where abstraction takes place.
- core
             Random crap that doesn't go anywhere else
- struct
             Commonly used data structures that are used across the code base go here.  For example images.
