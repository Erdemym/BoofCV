- standard wavelet algorithms
  * inner
  * border
- unrolled
  * benchmark to see if scale and wavelet can be processed in two cycles and not inside the same loop
- Create integer implementations using code generator
- WaveletTransformOps
  * call these optimized inner functions
- Abstracted object oriented wrapper for all of this
