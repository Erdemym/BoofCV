- Median Filter
 * Image Edges, handle them

- Derivative
 * Gaussian derivative kernel 1D
 * Improve performance of derivative edge calculation

- Edges
 * Whole image:
    - Intensity and orientation
 * Connected Segments
    - Canny?

- Thresholding
 * Global Threshold
 * Adaptively select global threshold
 * Local Threshold

- Corners
 * See corner section
 * See in code comment on speeding up fast-non-max
 
- Convolve
 * Change TestConvolveImageStandard into a completely automated test using reflections
 * Add a new implementation for horizontal and vertical which are "in-place"
   Uses an array one row/column long in which the image is locally copied.
 * Sparse Kernel Convolve for when there is a lot of zeros
   - Unroll
   - Compare speed to hand derived kernels in gradient

- Improve Sort Median Filter
*   Use bubble sort to avoid resorting each time

- InterpolateRectangle
 * Have output be an image

- Convolution Downsampling
 * Optimize a bit more by only running the re-normalize code on the outer most regions.

- Have a morphological filter section?
 * Add gray scale morphological operators
 * Handle image edges for binary and gray scale
   - Create a wrapper around image for naive implementation.
     + zeros or ones when outside of image for dilation and erosion
