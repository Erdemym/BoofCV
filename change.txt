---------------------------------------------
Date    : 2012/
Version : Alpha 0.6

- Added convolution related code for ImageSInt32
- Added weighted KLT and Harris corner detectors
- Refactored factory names and other classes to make them easier to find
  and more consistent
- Planar calibration grid detectors
  * Chess board pattern
  * Square grid pattern
- Generic code for detecting squares in binary images
  * Inside of calibration module
- Application for calibration from planar calibration targets
  * GUI and commandline

- ImageBorder
  * Added generalized get(x,y) 
- Refactored FactoryImageBorder into two factories
- Fixed bug in several derivative operators where the passed in border was being
  ignored and an extended border being used instead
- Change ImplImageDistort* to use interpolate.get_unsafe() to speed it up by a large margin
- Moved ImageDistort from boofcv.alg.distort to boofcv.struct.distort
- Added PointTransform_F32
- Added both forward and reverse radial distortion PixelTransform_F32 implementations
- ModelMatcher classes can now create multiple model hypotheses from a single set of points.
- Changed ImagePointTracker to use PointTrack instead of AssociatedPair
  * Created KeyFramePointTracker to track features and create AssociatedPairs
- Added FactoryEpipolar

---------------------------------------------
Date    : 2012/02/01
Version : Alpha 0.5

- Improved SURF performance
  * Fixed various bugs and changed algorithm to improve performance
    - Both speed and stibility have been improved
  * Now is the best performing SURF implementation in the benchmark
- ImplOrientationSlidingWindowIntegral has been replaced with a faster and more accurate algorithm
- Improved integral image support
- Improved sparse gradient support
- Refactored sparse image operator code
  * Added SparseImageSample interface
- Added/Improved unconstrained non-linear optimization code
  * Quasi-Newton line search
  * Levenberg-Marquardt
- Geometric vision and calibration code which uses non-linear optimization now works correectly
- Started converting internal micro benchmarks to use Caliper

---------------------------------------------
Date    : 2012/01/06
Version : Alpha 0.4

- Changed behavior of ConvertBufferedImage so that it won't automatically swap
  bands in MultiSpecitral image
  * orderBandsIntoRGB() has been provided to do that manually if needed
- All automatic convert to/from BGR and been removed from ConvertRaster
- Fixed SURF related issue
  * Image bounds check was being incorrectly performed for integral image
    orientation estimation algorithms (Thanks Oleg Chernoguz for pointing this out)
  * FactoryOrientationAlgs.sliding_ii() was creating an average orienation alg for I32 images
  * Some coordinates were integer instead of double
- Added comments to several factories and other classes
- Added ant script for examples and readme.txt explaining how to use it

---------------------------------------------
Date    : 2012/01/02
Version : Alpha 0.3

- Camera Calibration
  * Planar grid (Zhang 98)
  * Camera calibration matrix from homographies
  * Linear radial distortion
  * Decomposition of homography for calibration
  * Nonlinear optimization of all parameters
- Calibration Grid Detection
  * Detects corners up to "pixel accuracy", in reality its probably worse than that
  * Sub-pixel accuracy code exists but needs more work
- Added min and max values to ImageTestingOps.addGaussian()
- Tweaked factories related to wavelet denoising so that they take in
  an image type.
- Removed cyclical dependency between modules by creating a visualize modules
- Added to BinaryImageOps
  * label to clusters
  * clusters to binary
- Renamed ImageBase to ImageSingleBand
- Created a new ImageBase
- Flushed out MultSpectral image type more and extended ImageBase
  * Created functions to convert to and from BufferedImage
- Changed behavior of several functions in GeneralizedImageOps to include
  MultiSpectral images
  * refactor createImage -> createSingleBand 
- Updated ant scripts
  * Common template is now used for the different modules
  * Fixed unit test and make it work across the whole project
- Added crop to ImageDistort
  * If cropping is used the only part of the destimation image is processed
- Created calibration package to hold calibration related code
- Moved jars not part of the primary build into boofcv/lib/testing
- Started converting runtime benchmark code over to Caliper
  * http://code.google.com/p/caliper/

---------------------------------------------
Date    : 2011/12/01 
Version : Alpha 0.2

- Added integer polynomial interpolation
  * Cleaned up polynomial interpolation code

- Converting to a BufferedImage now marks it as modified
- Added min and max pixel values to ImageTypeInfo
- Added ComplexMath
- Added PolynomialSolver
- Added process(image) to PointSequentialTracker and renamed it to ImagePointTracker
- Added the following 3D vision code:
  * Linear 8-point essential/fundamental matrix
  * Linear 7-point essential/fundamental matrix
  * Linear 4-point homography
  * Extract camera motion from essential
  * Extract camera and plane normal from homography
